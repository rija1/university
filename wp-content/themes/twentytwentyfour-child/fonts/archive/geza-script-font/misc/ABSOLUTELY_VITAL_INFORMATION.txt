Geza Script is a wild, calligraphic typeface.
It has a foreign look that is hard to put a name on, it could 
be seen as Eastern inspired or as a forgotten script from 
the European 1500's. 

Use Geza Script in a urbane logo or graphic project you want to 
emit confidence. 

The font is created by Måns Grebäck and contains an alternate 
alphabet, ligatures and support for hundreds of languages.
